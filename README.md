Engineering materials
====

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2022.

## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

## Materials (Components)

**Key Components of the Chat Jeepney T:**   


**Connectors:**

Establish reliable electrical connections between the microcontroller and various electronic components/modules, ensuring efficient signal and power transmission.

**Breadboard:**

Allows temporary construction of circuits without soldering, facilitating easy testing and modification of designs.

**Battery Holder:**

Secures the battery in place, ensuring stable and consistent power supply to the robot.

**Ultrasonic Sensor:**

Detects and measures the distance to obstacles by emitting ultrasonic waves and calculating their return time, helping the robot navigate safely.

**Sensor Shield:**

Simplifies the connection of multiple sensors to the microcontroller, providing labeled ports for secure and organized wiring.

**Servo Motor:**

Controls the steering mechanism for precise adjustments to the front wheels' angle, enabling accurate directional changes.

**DC Motor:**

Drives the rear wheels, providing necessary torque and speed for the robot's movement.

**Motor Driver:**

Manages the DC motors' speed and direction, ensuring efficient and accurate response to the microcontroller's commands.

**IR Sensors:**

Detect specific colors on the mat by measuring reflected infrared light, allowing the robot to identify and respond to red and green obstacles.

**Buck Converter:**

Steps down the voltage from the battery to suitable levels for the microcontroller and other components, ensuring proper power distribution.

**Wheels:**

Enable the robot's movement, driven by the DC motors and steered by the servo motor.

**Acrylic Chassis:**

Provides a sturdy and lightweight frame to hold all the components together securely.

**Battery:**

Supplies power to all the robotâ€™s components, ensuring consistent operation.

**Code**

Shown here is the block code in aisteam usede for the obstacle challenge.
